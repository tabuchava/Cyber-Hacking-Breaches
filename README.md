## Introduction
Cybersecurity breaches have been steadily increasing, posing critical risks to organizations. This project uses a dataset from 2005â€“2017, containing detailed records of cyber hacking activities. By applying stochastic processes and machine learning models, the goal is to predict future breaches and analyze the severity of past incidents to help organizations better protect their data.

## Features
- Statistical analysis of cyber breach data
- Prediction of breach occurrences using machine learning (Support Vector Machine)
- Data visualization through charts and graphs
- Secure data access and user authentication
- Trend analysis of cyber threat evolution

## System Architecture
The system is built on a client-server architecture with Django as the backend framework, and MySQL serves as the database. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which helps in visualizing breach data effectively.

   python manage.py migrate
   
5. Run the Django development server:
   bash
   python manage.py runserver
   

## Usage
1. *User Registration & Login:* Sign up or log in to access the system.
2. *Upload Data:* Users can upload breach datasets in various formats.
3. *Data Analysis & Prediction:* The system processes the uploaded data to predict future breaches.
4. *Visualization:* Breach trends are displayed in easy-to-read charts and tables.

## Results
- The system successfully predicts breach trends based on historical data.
- The use of stochastic process modeling yields better accuracy compared to traditional statistical methods.
- The analysis provides valuable insights, enabling organizations to better understand and mitigate cyber risks.

## Future Enhancements
